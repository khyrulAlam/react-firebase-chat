Hello there! It looks like you've opened the console to check out my code. Welcome to the world of programming!

First off, I want to let you know that I'm still learning and not a professional developer yet. Please bear with any mistakes you might find.

Feel free to check out my other projects on GitHub: http://github.com/khyrulAlam. If you have any questions or feedback, you can reach me at khyrulalam69@gmail.com.

#### About Me ####

I'm passionate about learning new technologies, enjoying coffee, watching movies, playing FIFA, traveling, and listening to music.
